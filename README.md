# GardeCalcu
software to calculate grades from file, software can be modified to take any file.

this code was writen and compilled succesfully using VisualStudio 2019 on a windows 10 computer.
the name of the file used as example is named "Fall2020Grades.txt", but in order for the .txt file to work as expected, the files must be inside the same "GardeCalcu" file
as the .vcxproj files.

I have already included the file in the proper location for convenience.

if user wishes to use a different .txt file, the name of the file must be changed on line 42.
